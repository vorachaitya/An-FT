Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable eg Unique Art.

What is **_ERC-721_**? ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs
